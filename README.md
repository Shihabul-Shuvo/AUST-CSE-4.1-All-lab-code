# AUST-CSE-4.1-All-lab-code
AUST CSE 4th year 1st semester's lab assignments (e.g Formal language and compilers, Distributed Database System, Artificial Intelligenece) are here (Except for Computer Networks Sessional).
There might be some errors in the code. So, feel free to recheck and update when your use.

Note: In the solution of assignment 4, if there is a a error like reading some gurbaze value form the input file at the start then try uncomenting line no 58. That will skip the first 3 character from the file. If there is a gurbaze value at the start or at the the end then these characters can be removed using this method.
